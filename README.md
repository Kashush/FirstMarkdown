This repository analysis a data set that recorded the number of steps taken in five minute time intervals over two months.

Calculations and graphs demonstrate 
- the total number of steps per day
- the average number of steps for each five minute time interval
- how weekdays compare to weekends
- the mean and average number of steps per day for the full two month period.

Some observations were missing the number of steps.  A second data set had the missing values filled in by the average value for that time period.
